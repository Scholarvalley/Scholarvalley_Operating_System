        <p>The goal of ScholarValley is to help students with admission into Universities in United States of America as well as Canada. Our first priority is to help students <strong>reduce the total cost of their education</strong>. We <strong>guarantee 75% of our applicants partial or full scholarships</strong> as well as an <strong>admission in at least three universities</strong> in the country of their choice (United States or Canada). Full scholarships are mostly based on school performance. Partial scholarships depend on multiple other factors. Our specialty is to acquire them for you.</p>

We work with a large group of companies as well as Universities and colleges to guarantee you admission.
